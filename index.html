        <p>California pesticides application data, 2003-2012</p>

<p>This package contains the data used to produce the online maps (<a href="http://apps.cironline.org/pesticides/">http://apps.cironline.org/pesticides/</a>) for The Center for Investigative Reporting's series on California pesticide use.</p>

<p>The data is stored in three GeoJSON files, which should allow it to be accessed from a wide range of GIS and mapping tools.</p>

<p>The files are:</p>

<h2>
<a id="cagrids_cachedjson" class="anchor" href="#cagrids_cachedjson" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>cagrids_cached.json</h2>

<p>Data from California's Department of Pesticide Regulation's PUR database, 2003-2012. The file includes all baseline meridian/township/range/section grids with at least one agricultural application. Those grids are generally about 1 square mile in area, though the sizes at times vary considerably.</p>

<p>These grids sometimes cross county lines. In the PUR data, to get the total applied across the whole grid, you will need to use the sum of the two segments. We have kept the two segments separate in reporting the PUR data because it allows us the most granular data possible on the map. Please note: This is handled differently in our 1,3-D data from Dow, as you may read below.</p>

<h2>
<a id="cametagrids_cachedjson" class="anchor" href="#cametagrids_cachedjson" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>cametagrids_cached.json</h2>

<p>Data from California's Department of Pesticide Regulation's PUR database, 2003-2012. The file includes all baseline meridian/township/range grids with at least one agricultural application. Those grids are generally about 6 square miles in area, though the sizes at times vary considerably. The metagrids layer is more suitable for mapping the state as a whole, and is the layer used at wider zoom levels on the CIR map.</p>

<p>These grids sometimes cross county lines. In the PUR data, to get the total applied across the whole grid, you will need to use the sum of the two segments. We have kept the two segments separate in reporting the PUR data because it allows us the most granular data possible on the map. Please note: This is handled differently in our 1,3-D data from Dow, as you may read below.</p>

<h2>
<a id="telone_cachedjson" class="anchor" href="#telone_cachedjson" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>telone_cached.json</h2>

<p>Data specific to the chemical 1,3-Dichloropropene, collected by Dow AgroSciences for California's Department of Pesticide Regulation. This data is used to determine if pesticide applicators and farmers are using more 1,3-D than is allowed by state regulations. Please note: Numbers from the Dow data are likely to NOT MATCH numbers from the PUR data, because Dow reports the number of "adjusted pounds" of 1,3-D used. "Adjusted pounds" take into account safety precautions the pesticide applicator may (or may not) have taken in applying the chemica, which may lower or raise (respectively) the adjusted pounds for each application.</p>

<p>The 1,3-D regulatory limits are based on the larger "metagrids," or Baseline meridian/township/range combinations. Those grids are generally about 6 square miles in area, though the sizes at times vary considerably.</p>

<p>These grids sometimes cross county lines. In the 1,3-D data, both segments of a grid that crosses county lines will show the same number of adjusted pounds. This is because the regulatory limit for 1,3-D is based on the grid as a whole, even though each county is responsible for reporting data about its segment separately. Please note: This is handled differently in our PUR data, as you may read above.</p>
